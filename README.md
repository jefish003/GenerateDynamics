# GenerateDynamics
A package for generating some common dynamics on networks, as well as some types of analysis.

Getting started: Packages you will need: numpy, networkx, copy, scipy

Introduction to the methods:
A main class is the laplacian_dynamics class. This can be used for diffusive coupling on top of the network.

```
from GenerateDynamics import laplacian_dynamics
ld = laplacian_dynamics()
